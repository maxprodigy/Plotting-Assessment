# Project Title: Analyzing Fuel Efficiency and Carbon Emissions

# Description: 
This project aims to explore the relationship between vehicle characteristics (e.g., engine size, weight) and fuel efficiency, as well as carbon dioxide emissions.

# Dataset: 
The dataset used for this analysis is the fuel_econ dataset, which contains vehicle co2 Emissions, Unique IDs, Brand e.t.c.

# Methodology:

Data cleaning and preprocessing: 
Handling missing values, outliers, and converting data types as needed.
Exploratory data analysis: 
I am using visualizations and summary statistics to understand the data distribution.+
Model building and evaluation: 
Training and evaluating various machine learning models to predict fuel efficiency or carbon emissions.

# Tools and Technologies:
- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
